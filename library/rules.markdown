Library Rules and Office Hours
------------------------------

While we try to showcase the best of anime in our weekly screenings, there's a lot more out there than we can possibly show. Therefore, we also maintain a large collection of anime and manga in our circulating library. Library cardholders gain the additional privilege of checking out items from our library for home viewing; for more information, consult the section below.

We hold weekly office hours in our library in W20-441 (fourth floor of the Student Center). All are invited to come in during these times to browse our extensive collections [cataloged here](https://www.libib.com/u/mitanime), and library cardholders may use these hours to borrow materials. In addition, non-members are also free to come in and read our manga and watch our anime during this time.

Office Hours
------------

These are the times when someone will definitely be in the library. Officers often hold unscheduled office hours, so if you're in the Student Center, feel free to stop by!

Library Cardholders
-------------------

Individuals may apply for a library card by coming to any office hour in W20-441! The card allows one to check out up to 30 items at any given time (up to 6 DVDs, 6 manga/books, 6 audio CDs, 6 fansub discs, 6 VHS tapes) and place items on hold; upon return, they may check out additional items.

E-mail <anime-library@mit.edu> for questions or to request holds.


Library Checkout Polices
-----------------

-   Checkouts are limited to club members with current library cards (to be presented upon checkout).
-   Members may check out up to: 6 DVDs, 6 books or volumes of manga, 6 fansub discs, 6 audio CDs, and 6 VHS tapes, for at most thirty items out at any given time.
-   Items are due back in one month, but may be renewed by e-mail to <anime-library@mit.edu> or in person at a library, showing, or event, for up to 2 months. You may turn them in early if you wish in order to check out new material. You will not be allowed to check out additional items if you have overdue items checked out.
-   Overdue fines are fifty cents ($0.50) per day per item, for up to the MSRP replacement cost of the title.
-   If you lose, break, scratch, demagnetize, or otherwise render a title uncirculatable, you will be held responsible for the MSRP replacement cost of the title, circumvented by providing an actual replacement copy of the item.
