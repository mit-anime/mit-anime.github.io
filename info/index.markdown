**Overview**

The MIT Anime Club is a non-profit MIT student organization dedicated to
increasing the awareness of Japanese animation *(anime)* on campus.

We hold free [showings](../showings/) for current MIT students, faculty,
and staff. Showings are usually held weekly on Friday nights in room
[3-133](http://whereis.mit.edu/map-jpg?mapterms=3-133&mapsearch=go%20).
Most of our material is subtitled in English, allowing the
non-Japanese-speaking viewer to enjoy this rich and varied cultural
form. We maintain a library of Blu-Rays, DVDs, tapes, CDs, and other
media for members.

The Club has an established relationship with [The Arts at
MIT](http://web.mit.edu/arts/) for those further interested in creative
and artistic connections between anime and the community.
